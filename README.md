# Motherlode
Motherlode aims to expand the game's progression, making it take longer, but at the same time feel more engaging and
fun. It is separated into modules that add to different aspects of Minecraft.

## Outdated repository
**This repository is an outdated version of the Motherlode project.** The Team Motherlode decided to split the mod into a couple of smaller, content-themed mods.
